Uploading Screenshots
=====================

Screenshots or other images can be added to a review request. These can
be helpful in seeing how the change affects the presentation of a program,
or they can be used for reviewing mockups.

There are two ways to upload a review request:

1. Click :guilabel:`Add Screenshot` on the action bar, browse for the
   file to upload, and optionally enter a caption for the image.

2. Drag the image from your file manager into the review request. While
   dragging, a :guilabel:`Screenshots` section will appear (if there isn't
   one already) with a :guilabel:`Drop screenshots here to upload` box.
   If you drop the file there, it will upload. You can upload multiple
   screenshots at once this way.

   Note that this requires a modern HTML5-capable browser, such as
   Google Chrome or Firefox 3.6.
