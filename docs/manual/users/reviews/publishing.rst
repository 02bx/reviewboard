Publishing Reviews
==================

You can publish your review by clicking :guilabel:`Publish Review` on the
:ref:`review draft banner <review-draft-banner>` or
:ref:`Review Dialog <review-dialog>`.

After publishing your review, it will show up in the review request page with
all the comments you've written. Anybody can reply to your comments to discuss
your feedback.

If the administrator has enabled e-mail support, the owner of the review
request and all existing reviewers will be e-mailed a copy of your new review.
Notifications may also be sent to any chat services you have configured.

Once you have published a review, you can't go back and edit it (but you can
later :ref:`revoke a Ship It! <revoking-ship-it>` if you filed one).


.. _publish-review-submitter-only:

Publishing to the Submitter Only
================================

If your comments are pretty trivial, or not worth e-mailing out to everyone
who's watching, you can choose to publish reviews only to the submitter/owner
of the change. Everyone can still see them on the review request page, but
they won't receive e-mails.

You can do this by hovering over the drop-down arrow on the :guilabel:`Publish
Review` and choosing :guilabel:`To Submitter Only` (instead of clicking
:guilabel:`Publish Review` directly). That will immediately publish your
change only to the submitter.
