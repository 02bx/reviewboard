=================================
Review Board 1.7.29 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: TBD


Extensions
==========

* Added an is_enabled_for mechanism for ``NavigationBarHook``.

  ``NavigationBarHook`` can now decide whether or not to enable itself for
  each user.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fix Python 2.6 compatibility for the :command:`condensediffs` management
  command.

  Review Board 1.7.28 introduced this command, but a bug was preventing it from
  working when using Python 2.6.

* Prevent updating a closed review request.

  After a review request was closed, it still had a fully-functioning "Update"
  menu, which allowed new diffs and file attachments to be added. This has been
  fixed, and all updates are now prevented until the review request is
  reopened.
