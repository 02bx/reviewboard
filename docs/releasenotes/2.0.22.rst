=================================
Review Board 2.0.22 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: TBD


New Features
============

* Added tooltips to the file summary graphs in the diff viewer file list.
  (:bug:`3812`)

  The small circular graphs which show a summary of the size and type of
  changes to each file now have tooltips that list the exact number of added,
  removed, or changed lines.

  Patch by Evan Huntzinger.


Bug Fixes
=========

Review Requests
---------------

* Fix incorrect "Are you sure you want to leave this page" pop-ups on Firefox.
  (:bug:`3727`)

  Editing fields in Firefox could cause an issue where the unsaved changes
  confirmation box was shown even when there were no unsaved changes.

  Patch by Mike Conley.


Git
---

* Repositories using git URLs with inline authentication credentials can now be
  successfully added.

  Patch by Matt Comben.


Web API
-------

* Diff validation now includes more detailed error messages.

  If a diff fails to validate due to an error communicating with the
  repository, the reported error would be that the diff could not be parsed.
  The :ref:`webapi2.0-validate-diff-resource` now reports a much more detailed
  error that actually explains what went wrong.
