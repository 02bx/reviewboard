Review Board 3.0.11 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: TBD


New Features
============

* Added support for modern Bitbucket WebHooks for auto-closing review
  requests.

  Bitbucket recently removed support for their legacy WebHooks, breaking
  Review Board deployments that used that for auto-closing review requests.

  This release adds support for the modern WebHooks. Administrators will
  need to re-add WebHooks (see our :ref:`instructions
  <repository-hosting-bitbucket-config-webhooks>`).

* Increased the maximum length of repository names to 255. (:bug:`4730`)

  Some users manage so many repositories that it makes sense to just use the
  repository URLs/clone paths as the repository names. This gives them much
  more room to do that, bringing the maximum length from 64 to 255.

  Patch by Praise Ayorinde.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed the error information when unable to determine the GitLab API version.
  (:bug:`4737`)

  Users with self-hosted GitLab installs have run into errors saying that the
  GitLab API version could not be determined. We've found this is generally
  caused by either a domain name resolution issue or an untrusted SSL
  certificate.

  The error displayed now includes information on the original error, for
  diagnostic purposes, and lists possible causes.

* Fixed sending of WebHook payloads using certain data types. (:bug:`4759`)

  This builds upon fixes in 3.0.10, supporting more data types that weren't
  being properly handled in WebHook payloads.
