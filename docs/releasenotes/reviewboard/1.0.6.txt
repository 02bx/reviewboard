================================
Review Board 1.0.6 Release Notes
================================

**Release date**: March 27, 2010


Feature Improvements
====================

* Added a :guilabel:`[Discarded]` label for discarded review requests on the
  :guilabel:`All My Requests` page. (:bug:`1350`)


Performance Improvements
========================

* The dashboard suffered from speed problems in the past, particularly with
  certain types of columns. Much work has been done to heavily optimize the
  dashboard. There should be a very noticeable speed increase in this release.


Bugs Fixed
==========

* Fixed compatibility issues with Django 1.2 and newer versions of Djblets.

* Fixed a badly generated path in the search-cron.conf. rb-site was putting
  the wrong path in this file, making it unusable without modification.
  (:bug:`1181`)

* Fixed an issue with displaying comment flags on consecutive lines. If two
  comments were placed on two consecutive lines, we would sometimes
  only show the first comment. Patch by Laurent Nicolas. (:bug:`1377`)

* Fixed retrieving file contents in Bazaar when the file was moved in a
  previous revision. Patch by Kay Röpke. (:bug:`1393`)

* Fixed an Index Out of Range error with Subversion when the last file in
  a diff is empty. Patch by Simon Morley. (:bug:`1402`)

* We now strip the base directory field in the Upload Diff and New
  Review Request forms in order to prevent some confusing errors with
  leading/trailing spaces. (:bug:`1451`)
